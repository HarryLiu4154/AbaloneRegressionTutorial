# AbaloneRegressionTutorial
PyCaret is an open source Python library which is designed to be simplistic in code. It is a machine learning and model management tool meant to reduce the amount of time spent on experiment cycles. This research project was conducted on the Abalone dataset with the age (Rings) as the target parameter. It was determined that CatBoostRegressor was the overall best model in various aspects and many comparison calls and plots displayed this conclusion.
